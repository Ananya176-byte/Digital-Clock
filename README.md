# Digital-Clock
PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project is a 24-hour digital clock designed and simulated in Multisim. The clock displays hours, minutes, and seconds using T flipflops, logic gates, and 7-segment displays. It follows a modular design, where each section (seconds, minutes, hours) is implemented using counter by T flipflops. 

FEATURES:

✔ Displays time in HH:MM:SS format

✔ 24-hour time system

✔ Uses cascaded fliflops for making each section (hours, minutes, seconds)

✔ Reset function to reset the clock to 00:00:00

✔ Implemented using Multisim for simulation
